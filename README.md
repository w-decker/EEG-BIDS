# EEG-BIDS
## Code that converts raw BrainVision files into BIDS compatible format

The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a standard that has been adopted to ensure the dissemination of imaging data is consistent and standardized to improve replication efforts, transparency and literacy. Resources for BIDS can be found [here](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/).
